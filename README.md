# Dasie

DAta Structures In Elixir.

Implementations of some data structures for fun and learning. I don't recommend using these for anything important.

## Available data structures

- [Linked list](lib/linked_list.ex)
- [Binary Search Tree](lib/bst.ex)
- [Trie / prefix tree](lib/trie.ex)
- [Red-black Tree](lib/red_black_tree.ex)
- [Sorted set](lib/sorted_set.ex)
- [Cuckoo filter](lib/cuckoo_filter.ex)

Example usage is in the [tests](test/). Testing has been a focus since the start of this project.
There should be plenty of example based tests, and some property based ones (still WIP) for each implementation.

`*` = Unfinished/WIP
